## Methods

In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as **objects**.

A **property** is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

A **method** is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).

```javascript
<html>
<body>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
// getElementById is a 'method'
// innerHTML is a 'property'
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

* getElementById
* innerHTML

> The innerHTML property can be used to get or change any HTML element, including <html> and <body>.
